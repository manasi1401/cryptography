Language: Python 
Compiler Python 3.6
Libraries required: Numpy, Matplotlib and Math
Files in the Repository:
1) ADFGX.py: Encrypt and Decrypt using ADFGX cipher (run the script to test)
2) Affine.py: Encrypt and Decrypt using Affine Cipher, Attacks on Affine (run the script to test)
3) Basictest.py: Contains program to let user interact with and test all cryptomath library functions. (run the script to test)
4) Cryptomath.py Contains functions like gcd, egcd, is_prime, factorizations, random_prime, modular inverse and modular power
5) des64.py: Encrypt and Decrypt using 64 bit DES, (run the script to test)
6) Frequency.py: Analyze freqency of english alphabet is a given text file and prints the top two frequency letters. (run the script to test)
7) rsa.py: Key generation, encryption and decryption for RSA algorithm (run the script to test)
8) s_des.py: Encrypt and decrypt using simplified DES (run the script to test)
9) vigenere.py: Encrypt and decrypt using vigenere cipher, attacks on Vigenere (run the script to test)
10) Hybrid.py: Mimicing of SSL using DES and RSA originally written for AOA course. Thought it would be interesting to have it in this catalog. 

Further instruciton:
You can run individual files and they will usually ask for some form user input to run the functions. Look at the Algorithm Documentation for further information.
